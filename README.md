This project classifies emails as spam or ham (non-spam). It trains 9 classification algorithms on the dataset 'emails.csv'. I took this dataset from kaggle, you can use any spam/ham dataset of your choice. This project also compares the results of these 9 classifiers with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score. There's also an option to do a real-time prediction at the end using the classifier of your choice on an unseen email. 
The classification techniques used in this are: Adaboost, Bagging, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest
